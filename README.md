**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

  The Inventory App was develop to offer a simple and affordable way for small business to keep track of the products currently in stock. The application was designed to utilize two databases, once that keeps user's credentials while the other one keeps the product's name and quangtity on hand. Inventory management is crucial for any business, it provides the certainty of products on hand to meet current demands and it allows the possibility of having enough product stock to meet future sales demands while keeping costs low on ordering and carrying inventory. Keeping an accurate inventory has benefits that goes beyond meeting customerâ€™s demands, it has many financial benefits, especially when is tax season, knowing how much was invested in products makes it easier to calculate the profit brought in by those products, having previous inventory records is invaluable if the company happens to be audited by IRS. 

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

  When trusted in creating the Inventory application requiring a reliable database that provides real-time data for accurate product availability, the design process includes a user friendly interface that is intuitive and requires no previous training to operate, little time to setup and little effort to add/remove items; Configurable alerts that will notify a responsible party about low stock numbers when triggered; The application would require a database that allows for many products with a minimum of two tables, accessing the database should require inputting credentials and the default view should display all the items in the inventory,
  
**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

  Interpreting the user's needs is a lot more difficult to accomplish than it may seem, it is almost like the developer is required to translate the user's needs into features and abilities. There are requirements the user may be very explicit, like including features, when looking at a banking application, as a user, I require the ability to deposit checks by using the mobile's device camera to take a picture of the check, I don't feel the need to specify a menu should be available that includes a deposit as one of the options. I feel like it is the developer's job to read between the lines of requirements and what is automatically expected from the interface and functionality. My approach to developing applications is keeping things as simple as possible, placing menu options in readily available spots.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

  Testing was done as the app was developed, each time a new feature was implemented the application was run on the Android Emulator and testing was perfomed. The testing process is crucial in ensuring the application behaves as expected and improves user experience. Perfomrming tests as I coded allow =ed me to catch up on bugs and coding mistakes I commited as I wrote them, making fixing these issues easier because the program as recent. 

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

  When looking at the finalized application, I did not get the oucome I had designed, I was hoping the application would have additional features that would allow the user to utilize the device's built-in camera to scan bar codes on the products and allow additing items to the inventory that way. The ability to filter through different item categories was initially in my design plan, but I was not able to integrate the feature by the delivery deadline. Overall, I am proud of how the application came out given the limited amount of time I had to learn the subjects from the course and develop the application.

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

  The application's ability to integrate with SQLite databases was my biggest concerns prior to starting the development process, while looking at the mobile application, the fact the application's interface successfully communicates with the databases demonstrates my skills in getting the assignemnt done even if it is intimidating and unknown, the experience provided by this application is inavuluable.
